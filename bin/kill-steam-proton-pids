  # This bash one-liner performs the following tasks:
  # 1. It sets the PS_PERSONALITY environment variable to 'linux' which standardizes the output format of the 'ps' command.
  # 2. Runs the 'ps' command with the following options:
  #    - 'e' to include processes from all users,
  #    - 'o pid,args' to only show process ID and command arguments,
  #    - '--sort=-pid' to sort by process ID in descending order (so it kills the newest processes first),
  #      (unavailable on macOS so used 'sort -nr' instead)
  #    - '--no-headers' to not include column headers in the output. (unavailable on macOS so used 'tail -n +2' instead)
  # 3. It relies on external helper `steam-procs` to produce the filtered ps output described above.
  # 4. That output is piped to awk again to print only the first column (the process ID) safely, regardless of spacing.
  # 5. Finally, it pipes these process IDs to 'xargs' which executes the 'kill' command for each ID, terminating the processes.

  sleep 2 # give it a chance to seppuku
  # This usually leaves ~2 processes running still, which we now kill with extreme prejudice. You had your chance.
