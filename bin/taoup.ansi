[37mDesign the data, not the code.[0m[30m[1m - Jon Devaan[0m[0m
[37m[1mDesigning a computer system is very different from designing an algorithm[0m[0m[37m: The external interface (that is, the requirement) is less precisely defined, more complex, and more subject to change. The system has much more internal structure, and hence many internal interfaces. The measure of success is much less clear.[0m[30m[1m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m[0m
[37m[1mThere probably isn't a 'best' way to build the system, or even any major part of it[0m[0m[37m; much more important is to avoid choosing a terrible way, and to have clear division of responsibilities among the parts.[0m[30m[1m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m[0m
[37m[1mDefining interfaces is the most important part of system design.[0m[0m[37m Usually it is also the most difficult, since the interface design must satisfy three conflicting requirements: an interface should be simple, it should be complete, and it should admit a sufficiently small and fast implementation. Alas, all too often the assumptions embodied in an interface turn out to be misconceptions instead.[0m[30m[1m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m[0m
[37m[1mThe main reason interfaces are difficult to design is that each interface is a small programming language[0m[0m[37m: it defines a set of objects and the operations that can be used to manipulate the objects. Concrete syntax is not an issue, but every other aspect of programming language design is present.[0m[30m[1m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m[0m
[37m[1mDo one thing at a time, and do it well.[0m[0m[37m An interface should capture the [0m[37m[1mminimum[0m[0m[37m essentials of an abstraction. [0m[37m[1mDon't generalize[0m[0m[37m; generalizations are generally wrong.[0m[30m[1m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m[0m
[37m[1mWhen an interface undertakes to do too much its implementation will probably be large, slow and complicated.[0m[0m[37m An interface is a contract to deliver a certain amount of service; clients of the interface depend on the contract, which is usually documented in the interface specification. They also depend on incurring a reasonable cost (in time or other scarce resources) for using the interface; the definition of 'reasonable' is usually not documented anywhere. If there are six levels of abstraction, and each costs 50% more than is 'reasonable', the service delivered at the top will miss by more than a factor of 10.[0m[30m[1m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m[0m
[37m[1mService must have a fairly predictable cost, and the interface must not promise more than the implementer knows how to deliver.[0m[0m[37m Especially, it should not promise features needed by only a few clients, unless the implementer knows how to provide them without penalizing others. A better implementer, or one who comes along ten years later when the problem is better understood, might be able to deliver, but unless the one you have can do so, it is wise to reduce your aspirations.[0m[30m[1m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m[0m
[37mIf in doubt, leave it out.[0m
[37mExterminate features.[0m[30m[1m - Charles P. Thacker[0m[0m
[37m[1mPerfection must be reached by degrees[0m[0m[37m; she requires the slow hand of time.[0m[30m[1m - Voltaire[0m[0m
[37m[1mKeep secrets of the implementation.[0m[0m[37m Secrets are assumptions about an implementation that client programs are not allowed to make. In other words, they are things that can change; the interface defines the things that cannot change (without simultaneous changes to both implementation and client). Obviously, it is easier to program and modify a system if its parts make fewer assumptions about each other. On the other hand, the system may not be easier to design - it's hard to design a good interface. And there is a tension with the desire not to hide power.[0m[30m[1m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m[0m
[37m[1mOne way to improve performance is to increase the number of assumptions that one part of a system makes about another[0m[0m[37m; the additional assumptions often allow less work to be done, sometimes a lot less. For instance, if a set of size [0m[37m[1mn[0m[0m[37m is known to be sorted, a membership test takes time [0m[37m[1mlog n[0m[0m[37m rather than [0m[37m[1mn[0m[0m[37m. This technique is very important in the design of algorithms and the tuning of small modules. In a large system the ability to improve each part separately is usually more important. Striking the right balance remains an art.[0m[30m[1m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m[0m
[37m[1mDivide and conquer.[0m[0m[37m A well known method for solving a hard problem: reduce it to several easier ones. The resulting program is usually recursive. When resources are limited the method takes a slightly different form: bite off as much as will fit, leaving the rest for another iteration.[0m[30m[1m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m[0m
[37mAn efficient program is an exercise in logical brinkmanship.[0m[30m[1m - Edsger Dijkstra[0m[0m
[37m[1mUse a good idea again instead of generalizing it.[0m[0m[37m A specialized implementation of the idea may be much more effective than a general one.[0m[30m[1m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m[0m
[37m[1mHandle normal and worst cases separately[0m[0m[37m, because the requirements for the two are quite different: The normal case must be fast. The worst case must make some progress.[0m[30m[1m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m[0m
[37mNearly every non-trivial system has more specialized applications of caching. This is especially true for interactive or real-time systems, in which the basic problem is to incrementally update a complex state in response to frequent small changes. Doing this in an ad-hoc way is extremely error-prone. The best organizing principle is to recompute the entire state after each change but cache all the expensive results of this computation.[0m[30m[1m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m[0m
[37m[1mCompute in background when possible.[0m[0m[37m In an interactive or real-time system, it is good to do as little work as possible before responding to a request. The reason is twofold: first, a rapid response is better for the users, and second, the load usually varies a great deal, so there is likely to be idle processor time later in which to do background work. Many kinds of work can be deferred to background.[0m[30m[1m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m[0m

In richness, plasticity, facility, and economy, the mental model has no peer, but, in other respects, it has short-comings. It will not stand still for careful study. It cannot be made to repeat a run. No one knows just how it works. It serves its owner's hopes more faithfully than it serves reason. It has access only to the information stored in one man's head. It can be observed and manipulated only by one person. Society rightly distrusts the modeling done by a single mind. Society demands consensus, agreement, at least majority. Fundamentally, this amounts to the requirement that individual models be compared and brought into some degree of accord. The requirement is for communication, which we now define concisely as 'cooperative modeling' - cooperation in the construction, maintenance, and use of a model.[0m[30m[1m - J.C.R.

[37mThe most robust programs isolate complexity in a way that lets significant parts of the system appear simple and straightforward and interact in simple ways with other components in the system.[0m[30m[1m - Terry Crowley[0m[0m
[37mPerformance analysis plays a key part in determining how and where to hide complexity.[0m[30m[1m - Terry Crowley[0m[0m
[37mSuccess in hiding complexity is determined not by the component doing the hiding but by the consumers of that component.[0m[30m[1m - Terry Crowley[0m[0m
[37m[1mIt is the fundamental role of a system designer to determine how to break down a system into components and layers; to make decisions about what to build and what to pick up from elsewhere.[0m[0m[37m An important element in large scale engineering is understanding how these decisions will play out over time. Change fundamentally underlies everything we do as programmers, so these design choices are not only evaluated in the moment, but are evaluated in the years to come as the product continues to evolve.[0m[30m[1m - Terry Crowley[0m[0m
[37m[1mLayers (or abstractions) are fundamentally leaky.[0m[0m[37m These leaks have consequences immediately but also have consequences over time, in two ways. One consequence is that the characteristics of the layer leak through and permeate more of the system than you realize. These might be assumptions about specific performance characteristics or behavior ordering that is not an explicit part of the layer contract. This means that you generally are more vulnerable to changes in the internal behavior of the component that you understood. A second consequence is it also means you are more dependent on that internal behavior than is obvious, so if you consider changing that layer the consequences and challenges are probably larger than you thought.[0m[30m[1m - Terry Crowley[0m[0m
[37m[1mLayers are too functional.[0m[0m[37m A component you adopt will have more functionality than you actually require. In some cases, the decision to use it is based on leveraging that functionality for future uses. You adopt specifically because you want to 'get on the train' and leverage the ongoing work that will go into that component. Consequences: [0m[37m[1m1[0m[0m[30m[1m)[0m[0m[37m The component will often make trade-offs that are biased by functionality that you do not actually require. [0m[37m[1m2[0m[0m[30m[1m)[0m[0m[37m The component will embed complexity and constraints because of functionality you do not require and those constraints will impede future evolution of that component. [0m[37m[1m3[0m[0m[30m[1m)[0m[0m[37m There will be more surface area to leak into your application. Some of that leakage will be due to true 'leaky abstractions' and some will be explicit (but generally poorly controlled) increased dependence on the full capabilities of the component.[0m[30m[1m - Terry Crowley[0m[0m
[37m[1mLayers get replaced.[0m[0m[37m Requirements evolve, systems evolve, components are abandoned. You eventually need to replace that layer or component. This is true for external component dependencies as well as internal ones.[0m[30m[1m - Terry Crowley[0m[0m

[37m[1mRevel in the asynchrony.[0m[0m[37m Rather than trying to hide it, you accept it and design for it.[0m[30m[1m - Terry Crowley[0m[0m
[37mWhen you see a technique like idempotency or immutability, you recognize them as ways of embracing the fundamental nature of the universe, not just one more design tool in your toolbox.[0m[30m[1m - Terry Crowley[0m[0m
[37m[1mMuch of performance analysis is about three things: locality, locality, locality.[0m[0m[37m Whether it is packing data on disk, managing processor cache hierarchies, or coalescing data into a communications packet, how data is packed together, the patterns for how you touch that data with locality over time and the patterns of how you transfer that data between components is fundamental to performance. Focusing on less code operating on less data with more locality over space and time is a good way to cut through the noise.[0m[30m[1m - Terry Crowley[0m[0m
[37mWhen looking at the structure of a system, I'm less interested in seeing how the code interacts...‚Ää[0m[37m[1mI want to see how the data interacts and flows[0m[0m[37m.[0m[30m[1m - Terry Crowley[0m[0m

[37m[1mCaches are fundamental but also dangerous.[0m[0m[37m Caches are trying to leverage the runtime behavior of the code to change the pattern of interaction between different components in the system. They inherently need to model that behavior, even if that model is implicit in how they fill and invalidate the cache and test for a cache hit. If the model is poor or becomes poor as the behavior changes, the cache will not operate as expected. A simple guideline is that [0m[37m[1mcaches must be instrumented[0m[0m[37m‚Ää-‚Äätheir behavior will degrade over time because of changing behavior of the application and the changing nature and balance of the performance characteristics of the components you are modeling. [0m[37m[1mEvery long-time programmer has cache horror stories.[0m[0m[30m[1m - Terry Crowley[0m[0m

[37m[1mThe human visual and nervous system [is] inherently constrained[0m[0m[37m, which means a system designer can leverage (must leverage) those constraints, e.g. by virtualization (limiting how much of the underlying data model needs to be mapped into view data structures) or by limiting the rate of screen update to the perception limits of the human visual system.[0m[30m[1m - Terry Crowley[0m[0m
[37m[1mI have struggled with complexity my entire career.[0m[0m[37m One of our key approaches for managing complexity is to 'walk away' and start fresh. Often new tools or languages force us to start from scratch which means that developers end up conflating the benefits of the tool with the benefits of the clean start. [0m[37m[1mThe clean start is what is fundamental. The simplest way of controlling complexity growth is to build a smaller system with fewer developers.[0m[0m[30m[1m - Terry Crowley[0m[0m
[37m[1mI used to say my job was to design feedback loops.[0m[0m[37m Transparent processes [are] a great tool for empowerment‚Ää-‚Ääthe manager can invest more and more local control in those closest to the problem because of confidence they have visibility to the progress being made. Coordination emerges naturally. Key to this is that the goal has actually been properly framed (including key resource constraints like ship schedule). Decision-making that needs to constantly flow up and down the management chain usually reflects poor framing of goals and constraints by management.[0m[30m[1m - Terry Crowley on technical management[0m[0m
[37m[1mOne dirty little secret you learn as you move up the management ladder is that you and your new peers aren't suddenly smarter because you now have more responsibility.[0m[0m[37m This reinforces that the organization as a whole better be smarter than the leader at the top. Empowering every level to own their decisions within a consistent framing is the key approach to making this true. Listening and making yourself accountable to the organization for articulating and explaining the reasoning behind your decisions is another key strategy. Surprisingly, fear of making a dumb decision can be a useful motivator for ensuring you articulate your reasoning clearly and make sure you listen to all inputs.[0m[30m[1m - Terry Crowley on technical management[0m[0m

This naturally means that cancellation is first-class. Some layer of the system (perhaps plumbed through to the user) will need to decide it has waited too long and cancel the interaction. Cancelling is only about reestablishing local state and reclaiming local resources‚Ää-‚Ääthere is no way to reliably propagate that cancellation through the system. It can sometimes be useful to have a low-cost, unreliable way to attempt to propagate cancellation as a performance optimization.[0m

When you send an operation, it may be lost in transit, it might be processed but the response is lost, or it may take some significant amount of time to process so the remote state ultimately transitions at some arbitrary time in the future. This leads to approaches like idempotent operations and the ability to robustly and efficiently rediscover remote state rather than expecting that distributed components can reliably track state in parallel. The concept of 'eventual consistency' succinctly captures many of these ideas.[0m

[37m[1mSuccess really depends on the conception of the problem, the design of the system[0m[0m[37m, not in the details of how it's coded.[0m[30m[1m - Leslie Lamport[0m[0m
[37mYou're not going to come up with a simple design through any kind of coding techniques or any kind of programming language concepts.[0m[37m[1m Simplicity has to be achieved above the code level[0m[0m[37m before you get to the point which you worry about how you actually implement this thing in code.[0m[30m[1m - Leslie Lamport[0m[0m
[37m[1mUML[0m[0m[37m - I know next to nothing about UML - but what I do know is the language was invented first and then people came around and tried to give semantics to the language. Well, in other words what that means is that the language was invented first and it really didn't mean anything. And then, later on, people came around to try to figure out what it meant. Well, that's not the way to design a specification language. The importance of a specification language is to specify something precisely, and therefore what you write - the specification you write - has to have a precise, rigorous meaning.[0m[30m[1m - Leslie Lamport[0m[0m

[37m[1mPeople use UML, things like UML, to model programs, but it's not clear how to translate them in to sequences of states, for concurrency. If you cannot translate them in to sequences of states, it means you don't understand them, and it may mean that there's nothing there. You know, there are lots of people selling snake-oil, drawing boxes and arrows that make you feel good, but ultimately have no real meaning. If something is really meaningful you should be able to express it in mathematics.[0m[0m[30m[1m - Leslie Lamport[0m[0m
[37m[1mThe benefit of using [a formal specification language] is that it teaches you to think rigorously, to think precisely[0m[0m[37m, and the important point is the precise thinking.

[37m[1mA lot of the problems[0m[0m[37m that exist in software, a lot of the problems that one encounters in writing... in building a system, in writing a program: those are problems that [0m[37m[1mare caused by not thinking about what you are doing before starting to code[0m[0m[37m.[0m[30m[1m - Leslie Lamport[0m[0m
[37mIf you're building a complicated system, [0m[37m[1mthe battle is won or lost before a single piece of code is written.[0m[0m[30m[1m - Leslie Lamport[0m[0m

[37mYou could decide that you want to do something - the what - and then when it comes to programming it you discover that you can't - that is, you don't know how or the how is too expensive or something like that. So I don't mean to imply that what you should first do is thinking completely abstractly about what something is supposed to do and then, only then do you think about how you do it. [0m[37m[1mPart of engineering is understanding what you can do in practice and what you can't[0m[0m[37m. But, given that caveat, [0m[37m[1myou really should understand what the system is doing before you try to implement it[0m[0m[37m.[0m[30m[1m - Leslie Lamport[0m[0m
[37mThere are two separate things you want to specify about a program or a system: [0m[37m[1mwhat it does[0m[0m[37m, and [0m[37m[1mhow it should do it[0m[0m[37m.[0m[30m[1m - Leslie Lamport[0m[0m
[37m[1mIt's really important to understand what something is supposed to do before you start to do it[0m[0m[37m. Very often, once you've decided precisely what something is supposed to do, implementing it - the coding, the how - is quite trivial, and it hardly needs a specification at all or might be so simple that you really can just start coding without writing any precise description of how it does it, beyond the specification of what it's supposed to do.[0m[30m[1m - Leslie Lamport[0m[0m
[37mFirst of all, [0m[37m[1mthere are lots of different things that can go by the name of specification[0m[0m[37m. I use all of them. Sometimes a specification I write is a few English sentences. Sometimes, it's a very complicated mathematical description of the object, the what or the how. Which one is appropriate depends on the problem: how hard the problem is, how important it is that it get done correctly, and various things like that.[0m[30m[1m - Leslie Lamport[0m[0m
[37m[1mAnything you do is an iterative process[0m[0m[37m. You start out by thinking about something, and then you start writing it, and in the course of writing it, you rewrite and you rewrite and you rewrite.[0m[30m[1m - Leslie Lamport[0m[0m
[37mA lot of programs I write just for my own use and I can live with the bugs and it's not that important that they be absolutely correct, but [0m[37m[1msometimes I write code for other people to use and I really want it to work right[0m[0m[37m.[0m[30m[1m - Leslie Lamport[0m[0m
[37mThe important thing is not the syntax of what you're writing: the important thing is the precision, the rigor. [0m[37m[1mIn order to understand things, you have to write them precisely.[0m[0m[37m I use mathematics because that is precise.[0m[30m[1m - Leslie Lamport[0m[0m

[37mWhat you need to avoid at all costs is any language that's all syntax and no semantics, because that is not going to get you to think rigorously - that's going to get you to fool yourself in to thinking that you're thinking.[0m[30m[1m - Leslie Lamport[0m[0m

[37m[1mThe essence of computing is discreteness[0m[0m[37m, and I believe that what one will discover is that the essence of perception is discretizing something.

[37m[1mGenerally it doesn't seem to be necessary to deal with Byzantine failures.[0m[0m[37m Using simple techniques like checksums to avoid corruption of data, it's generally felt that that kind of malicious behavior, outside of - where the malice is caused by failure not by hackers - you don't need Byzantine fault tolerance. So, in practice that means if the computers that you're building your system out of are under your control and not under hackers' control then you don't need Byzantine fault tolerance, in which case Paxos is basically the algorithm you should be using. There are different consensus algorithms that have been proposed but the ones that are practical in the sense that they're efficient are all equivalent to Paxos at least in the normal case, and Paxos works: use that. I mean it doesn't solve all your problems, because you still have the problem of optimizing: there are lots of optimization games you can play depending upon the particular nature of the state machine you're trying to implement, but if you understand the basic Paxos algorithm then you'll understand what optimizations can be made to get it to work well for your system.[0m[30m[1m - Leslie Lamport[0m[0m
[37m[1mIf you're not writing a program, you shouldn't use a programming language[0m[0m[37m, because programming languages are really complicated. They get more and more complicated. Now, they're complicated for good reason: they've got a difficult problem to solve, which is to be able to generate efficient code for these complicated machines, but there's a lot simpler way to describe systems, algorithms, whatever, and y'know it's a language that's been developed for a couple of thousand years for saying things precisely. It's mathematics.[0m[30m[1m - Leslie Lamport[0m[0m
[37m[1mComputation is not just about functions.[0m[0m[37m If computation were about functions then quicksort and bubble-sort were the same because they're computing the same function. As I said a computing device is something that goes through a sequence of states and what an assignment statement is doing is it is telling you here is a new state, and also there's the notion of its non-determinism, so the new state is not a function of the old state. So functional programming in a sense - functions - don't solve the problem of programming.[0m[30m[1m - Leslie Lamport[0m[0m
[37m[1mThe mathematics of computing - things like sets and functions and logic - are to computing what real numbers are to physics.[0m[0m[37m People who are writing programs should be as facile with that kind of very simple math as physicists are with numbers.[0m[30m[1m - Leslie Lamport[0m[0m

And I'll use up 20 sheets or more per hour when I'm exploring a problem, especially at the beginning. For the first hour I'm trying all kinds of stuff and looking for patterns. Later, after internalizing those calculations or drawings or whatever they are, I don't have to write quite so much down, and I'm getting closer to a solution. [0m[37m[1mThe best test of when I'm about ready to solve a problem is whether or not I can think about it sensibly while swimming[0m[0m[37m, without any paper or notes to help out.

It is much better to have basic operations executed quickly than more powerful ones that are slower (of course, a fast, powerful operation is best, if you know how to get it). The trouble with slow, powerful operations is that the client who doesn‚Äôt want the power pays more for the basic function. Usually it turns out that the powerful operation is not the right one.[0m[30m[1m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m[0m

The purpose of abstractions is to conceal undesirable properties; desirable ones should not be hidden. Sometimes, of course, an abstraction is multiplexing a resource, and this necessarily has some cost. But it should be possible to deliver all or nearly all of it to a single client with only slight loss of performance.[0m[30m[1m - Butler W. Lampson (1983)[0m[0m

This technique can greatly simplify an interface, eliminating a jumble of parameters that amount to a small programming language. A simple example is an enumeration procedure that returns all the elements of a set satisfying some property. The cleanest interface allows the client to pass a filter procedure that tests for the property, rather than defining a special language of patterns or whatever.[0m[30m[1m - Butler W.

[37m[1mKeep a place to stand if you do have to change interfaces.[0m[0m[37m One is the compatibility package, which implements an old interface on top of a new system.

Usually these simulators need only a small amount of effort compared to the cost of reimplementing the old software, and it is not hard to get acceptable performance. At a different level, the IBM 360/370 systems provided emulation of the instruction sets of older machines like the 1401 and 7090.

[37mWe are at the end of a five-thousand-year-plus historical process during which [0m[37m[1mhuman society grew in scale while it abandoned the early indigenous wisdom councils and communal decision-making.

The number of active pre-conditions is quite stunning, from elite isolation to concentrated wealth to inadequate socialisation and education, to concentrated land holdings to loss of authority to repression of new technologies especially in relation to energy, to the atrophy of the public sector and spread of corruption, to media dishonesty, to mass unemployment of young men and on and on and on. [...] Preconditions are not the same as precipitants. [0m[37m[1mWe are waiting for our Tunisian fruit seller[0m[0m[37m.

Internal language is based on recursive operations that yield what we called the Basic Property of language: generation of an infinite array of hierarchically structured expressions that are interpreted as thoughts.

--- 7 deadly sins of cloud computing research ---
[37m[1mSin #1 - Unnecessary distributed parallelism[0m[0m[37m: It does not always make sense to parallelize a computation. Doing so almost inevitably comes with an additional overhead, both in runtime performance and in engineering time. When designing a parallel implementation, its performance should [0m[37m[1malways[0m[0m[37m be compared to an optimized serial implementation in order to understand the overheads involved. If we satisfy ourselves that parallel processing is necessary, it is also worth considering whether [0m[37m[1mdistribution[0m[0m[37m over multiple machines is required. The rapid increase in RAM and CPU cores can make local parallelism economical and worthwhile. Establish the need for distributed parallelism on a case by case basis.[0m[30m[1m - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)[0m[0m
[37m[1mSin #2 - Assuming performance homogeneity[0m[0m[37m: Virtualized cloud environments exhibit highly variable and sometimes unpredictable performance. Base reported results on multiple benchmark runs, and report the variance.[0m[30m[1m - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)[0m[0m
[37m[1mSin #3 - Picking the low-hanging fruit[0m[0m[37m: It is unsurprising that it is easy to beat a general system by specializing it. Few researchers comment on the composability of their solutions. [0m[30m[1m - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)[0m[0m
[37m[1mSin #4 - Forcing the abstraction[0m[0m[37m: In some application domains, it is unclear if a MapReduce-like approach can offer any benefits, and indeed, some have argued that it is fruitless as a research direction. Ideally, future research should build on [iterative processing, stream processing and graph processing], rather than on the MapReduce paradigm.[0m[30m[1m - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)[0m[0m
[37m[1mSin #5 - Unrepresentative workloads[0m[0m[37m: The common assumption in academic research systems is that the cluster workload is relatively homogenous. Most research evaluations measure performance by running a single job on an otherwise idle cluster.[0m[30m[1m - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)[0m[0m
[37m[1mSin #6 - Assuming perfect elasticity[0m[0m[37m: The cloud paradigm [...] its promise of an unlimited supply of computation. This is, of course, a fallacy. Workloads do not exhibit infinite parallel speedup. The scalability and supply of compute resources are not infinite. There are limits to the scalability of data center communication infrastructure. Another reason for diminishing returns from parallelization is the increasing likelihood of failures and vulnerability to "straggler" tasks. [0m[30m[1m - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)[0m[0m
[37m[1mSin #7 - Ignoring fault tolerance[0m[0m[37m: Many recent systems neglect to account for the performance implications of fault tolerance, or indeed of faults occurring. For each system, we should ask whether fault tolerance is relevant or required. If it is, it makes sense to check precisely what level is required, and what faults are to be protected against; consider and ideally quantify the cost.[0m[30m[1m - Schwarzkopf et al, 'The seven deadly sins of cloud computing research' (2014)[0m[0m

[37mMath-based decisions command wide agreement, whereas judgment-based decisions are rightly debated and often controversial, at least until put into practice and demonstrated.
