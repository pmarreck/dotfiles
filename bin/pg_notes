# need to be postgres user
cat <<EOF
So here's the current postgres-on-linux strategy for local dev:
It's installed via asdf.
It runs as the local (NOT postgres!) user.
It should start with a simple `pg_ctl start` given whatever value PGDATA has.
Logs go... I don't know. Probably inside PGDATA? Or the cwd. Or specify it:
pg_ctl -l $HOME/pg.log start

The data is saved under whatever version of postgres you specified so if you switch...
Setting up a fresh db:
Make sure `locale` returns the right result (en-US.utf8 most likely).
Also, recommended to unset LC_ALL before doing so; too sledgehammer-y.
pg_ctl initdb
createuser -s postgres
maybe fire up psql, may need to create the mpnetwork db manually etc
