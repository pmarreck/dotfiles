Welcome to my OS X dotfiles. Truly exciting stuff. Enjoy.

I got tired of manually syncing my commandline config across machines and losing old versions of things.

I took some tips from https://github.com/rtomayko/dotfiles as well as https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles .

This is a work in progress and (hopefully) all sensitive information has been removed.

Note: Bash is assumed. (I decided to skip the zsh bandwagon once oh-my-bash showed up.) I may eventually try to transition to my fork of es-shell: https://github.com/pmarreck/es-shell

To apply this to a new computer or dev environment:

Install https://direnv.net/

Install https://starship.rs/

Clone this repo right inside your home directory (so, at ~/dotfiles).

Run ./dotfiles/install_dotfiles . This will symlink all the relevant files into ~, ~/bin/ ~/lib and ~/Scripts, making those dirs if they don't exist yet.

Open a new Terminal to make sure you're golden.
