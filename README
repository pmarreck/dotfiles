Welcome to my OS X dotfiles. Truly exciting stuff. Enjoy.

I got tired of manually syncing my commandline config across machines and losing old versions of things.

I took some tips from https://github.com/rtomayko/dotfiles as well as https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles .

This is a work in progress and (hopefully) all sensitive information has been removed.

To apply this to a new computer:

git clone URL subdir; mv subdir/.git .; git reset --hard

Then add a "*" line to the ~/.git/info/exclude file which forces you to add files with the -f option.
