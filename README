Welcome to my OS X dotfiles. Truly exciting stuff. Enjoy.

I got tired of manually syncing my commandline config across machines and losing old versions of things.

I took some tips from https://github.com/rtomayko/dotfiles as well as https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles .

This is a work in progress and (hopefully) all sensitive information has been removed.

To apply this to a new computer:

cd ~; git clone git@github.com:pmarreck/dotfiles.git; cp -R dotfiles/.git .; git reset --hard; rm -rf dotfiles; echo "*" >> .git/info/exclude

This will move the contents up one into your home directory and "recenter" the repo on that. (The expected caveats apply.) Then it adds a "*" line to the ~/.git/info/exclude file which forces you to add files with the -f option (otherwise you might accidentally add everything in your home directory).
